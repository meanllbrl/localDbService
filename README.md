* LocalDBService is designed to improve communication between developers and SQL Lite Database systems.

## Features
1. CREATE single table with the "create" function
2. CREATE multiple tables with the "multipleCreate" function
3. INSERT to the table with singular or multiple arrays
4. READ from tables with easy usage of "read" function
5. You can also UPDATE and DELETE

## Getting started

* The dbService object need to be created before usages.
* The database should be closed after the needed processes.

## Usage
!Firstly the object
```dart
LocalDBService dbService = LocalDBService(name: "batch.db");
```

**CREATE SINGLE TABLE
```dart
dbService.create(
                  tableName: "table",
                  parameters: "name TEXT,surname TEXT");
```

**CREATE MULTIPLE TABLES
```dart
    dbService.multipleCreate(
    tables: [
      //TABLE 1
      CreateModel(
        tableName: "table1",
        parameters: """ 
                        id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
                        ...
                    """,
                  ),
      //TABLE 2
      CreateModel(
        tableName: "table2",
        parameters: """ 
                        id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
                        ...
                    """,
                  ),
      );
```

**INSERT SINGLE DATA TO A TABLE
```dart
dbService.insert(
              tableName: "table",
              parameters: "name,surname",
              values: ["NAME", "SURNAME"]);
```

**INSERT MULTIPLE DATA TO A TABLE
```dart
dbService.insert(
              tableName: "test2",
              parameters: "name,surname",
              //multiple must be true
              multiple:true,
              values: [ ["NAME1", "SURNAME1"],
                        ["NAME2", "SURNAME2"]
                      ]);
```
